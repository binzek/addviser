## Things I used

- React.js
- Plain CSS
- AdviceSlip API
- Axios
- Google fonts
- Buy Me a Coffee

## Things I learned

As it's the first react project with API implementation and logical programming that I am working on, I faced a lot of challenges through out the process. All problems led me to learn and practice new things.

- Working with APIs and data fetching (Axios)
- How to actually use React hooks like _useEffect_
- Conditional rendering and other logical stuffs
- Javascript concepts such as Promises, etc.
- Attractive styling with CSS and other UI related things
- What is and how to use [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/)
- Building and deploying React apps efficiently

### Problem / Bug

- The animation of new advice loading is hardcoded to 1 second as I couldn't figure out why my implementation of loader while fetching the data fails. _Will fix on next update_.

### Acknowledgment
